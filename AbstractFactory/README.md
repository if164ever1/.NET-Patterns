## Description
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to create objects that are designed to work together and ensures that the created objects are compatible.

The Abstract Factory pattern is particularly useful when you need to create a set of related objects that belong to a common theme or have dependencies between them. It promotes the creation of families of objects rather than individual objects, ensuring that they are consistent and compatible.


In this example, we have a set of related products represented by the IButton and ICheckbox interfaces. We also have concrete implementations for these products, such as WindowsButton, MacOSButton, WindowsCheckbox, and MacOSCheckbox.

The IGUIFactory interface represents the abstract factory. It defines methods for creating the related products. We have two concrete factories, WindowsGUIFactory and MacOSGUIFactory, which implement the IGUIFactory interface and provide the concrete implementations for creating the Windows and macOS versions of the products.
