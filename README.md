## Introduction
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems that arise during software development. They serve as templates or blueprints for constructing reusable and maintainable code. This repository focuses on design patterns specifically related to C#.
Each pattern is described in detail, including its purpose, structure, and implementation guidelines. Examples and code snippets are provided to illustrate how to use the patterns effectively in C# applications.

## Patterns Covered
The following design patterns are currently covered in this repository:
1. Creational Patterns
    - [Singleton](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Singleton)
    - [Factory Method](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Builder](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Prototype](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
2. Structural Patterns
    - [Adapter](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Decorator](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Composite](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Facade](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Proxy](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
3. Behavioral Patterns
    - [Strategy](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Observer](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Template Method](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Command](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [State](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
  
The list above is not exhaustive, and more patterns will be added in the future. Contributions are welcome to expand the coverage of patterns.

## Description
- The Singleton pattern is often employed when you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object, providing a global point of access to that object throughout the application. It is commonly used for classes that manage shared resources, such as database connections, logging systems, or configuration settings.
## Getting Started
To get started with the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns.git.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: cd .NET-Patterns
3. Choose the pattern you want to explore and navigate to its directory: cd pattern-name
4. Review the documentation and code files related to the pattern
5. dotnet run

Make sure you have a C# development environment set up, including a compatible version of the .NET Framework or .NET Core.
