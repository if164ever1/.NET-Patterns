## Introduction
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems that arise during software development. They serve as templates or blueprints for constructing reusable and maintainable code. This repository focuses on design patterns specifically related to C#.
Each pattern is described in detail, including its purpose, structure, and implementation guidelines. Examples and code snippets are provided to illustrate how to use the patterns effectively in C# applications.

## Patterns Covered
The following design patterns are currently covered in this repository:
1. Creational Patterns
    - [Singleton](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Singleton)
    - [Factory Method](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/FactoryMethod)
    - [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/AbstractFactory)
    - [Builder](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Builder)
    - [Prototype](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Prototype)
2. Structural Patterns
    - [Adapter](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Adapter)
    - [Decorator](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Decorator)
    - [Composite](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Composite)
    - [Facade](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Facade)
    - [Proxy](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Proxy)
3. Behavioral Patterns
    - [Strategy](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/tree/main/Strategy)
    - [Observer](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Template Method](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [Command](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
    - [State](https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns/blob/main/Singleton/Program.cs)
  
The list above is not exhaustive, and more patterns will be added in the future. Contributions are welcome to expand the coverage of patterns.

## Getting Started
To get started with the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/if164ever1/.NET-Patterns.git.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: cd .NET-Patterns
3. Choose the pattern you want to explore and navigate to its directory: cd pattern-name
4. Review the documentation and code files related to the pattern
5. dotnet run

Make sure you have a C# development environment set up, including a compatible version of the .NET Framework or .NET Core.
## Usage
Each pattern directory contains a detailed README file explaining the pattern's concepts, usage guidelines, and example code. Review the README file of the specific pattern you're interested in to understand how to use it effectively.

Feel free to explore the examples, modify the code, and integrate the patterns into your own projects. The examples are intended to be educational and practical, serving as a reference for your own implementation.
