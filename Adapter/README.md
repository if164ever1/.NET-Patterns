## Description
The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. The Adapter pattern helps achieve interoperability and reusability of existing classes.

The Adapter pattern is useful in situations where you have existing classes or components that cannot directly work together due to incompatible interfaces. It allows you to adapt the interface of one class to match the interface expected by another class without modifying their existing code.

In this example, we have the ITarget interface, which represents the target interface expected by the client. The Adaptee class is an existing class with a specific interface that we want to adapt. The Adapter class implements the ITarget interface and internally holds an instance of the Adaptee class.

The Adapter class acts as a bridge between the ITarget interface and the Adaptee class by implementing the Request() method and invoking the SpecificRequest() method of the Adaptee within it.

In this example, we create an instance of the Adaptee class and pass it to the Adapter constructor, which internally holds the reference to the Adaptee. We then create an instance of the ITarget interface, which is actually an instance of the Adapter class. When we call the Request() method on the ITarget, it invokes the SpecificRequest() method of the Adaptee through the adapter, producing the desired result.

The Adapter pattern allows you to make existing classes work together by adapting their incompatible interfaces. It helps achieve interoperability between classes with minimal changes to their existing code, promoting reusability and flexibility.
